### Translation
- Accuracy: Precisely communicates the original meaning without omissions, additions, or distortions. Every essential idea, fact, or nuance from the source text should be preserved in the translation.
- Clarity: Be clear and easy to understand for the target audience. Ambiguities or awkward phrasing that confuse the reader should be avoided.
- Cultural Appropriateness: Takes into account cultural context, idioms, and references, adjusting them as necessary to make sense in the target language's cultural framework. This can involve adapting metaphors or phrases that don't translate directly.
- Fluency: Read smoothly and naturally, without sounding like a translation. The language used should conform to the linguistic norms and style of the target language, avoiding literal translations or overly mechanical renderings.
- Consistency: Terms, concepts, and style should be consistent throughout the translation, especially for specialized texts or recurring phrases. This ensures coherence and avoids confusing the reader.
- Style and Tone: Maintain the tone, mood, and style of the original. Whether formal, informal, humorous, or technical, the emotional and rhetorical effects of the source text should be mirrored.
